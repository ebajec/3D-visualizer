# opengl-framework
Basic 3D rendering components I have made from scratch with OpenGL.  

**To compile:** In the solution file or makefile, make sure to include a path to "lib" folder from [this repository](https://github.com/ebajec/linear-algebra) as an include directory.  That's where "matrix.h" comes from.
